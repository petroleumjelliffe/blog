title:  "Building a Pattern Library with a Pattern"

---

* Used YAML to created the outline structure, thanks to [this post on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12761152/yaml-front-matter-for-jekyll-and-nested-lists)
* Rebuilt Brad Frost's Pattern Library template in [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers)
* split the YAML Front matter and HTML template into 2 files, to make updating the library as simple as adding to the [Pattern Library outline](https://github.com/petroleumjelliffe/blog/blob/gh-pages/patterns-yaml.html) 
* Included our own Codepen samples
